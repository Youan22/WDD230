        <h3>Race to the Moon at Teton Elementary</h3>

            src="./images/teton-elementary-ice-320.jpg"

          />
        </p>
        <p>
          Teton Elementary in Teton, Idaho started a "Race to the Moon" project
          last September to promote physical activity while learning about
          space.
        </p>
        <p>
          They say they are trying to collect enough exercise miles to
          figuratively make it to the moon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along the way, teachers involved say they are also learning about
          geography. They would like to have people from all around the world
          submit 'exercise donations' from any place in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          They report so far they have received donations from 30 different
          states and 26 different countries. Now that it is winter and people
          are not out as much, they say it is harder to get miles. They are
          asking people around the community and world to donate their exercise
          miles to help get to the moon.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We need everyone's help! Could you please help us spread the word to
          the public by promoting our activity?"
